This is a ecommerce platform for buying and selling crochet products. The platform is built using Next.js and MongoDB.
We are using the following technologies:
- Next.js (Javascript)
- Tailwind CSS (CSS)
- MongoDB (Database)
- Appwrite for authentication and file storage
- Every route has page.js, layout.js, actions.js, loader.js, and components folder for the page.
- Use server components as much as possible
- Use server actions as much as possible instead of making api routes (unless needed)
- If client side data fetching is needed, use SWR library
- All pages must be fully mobile responsive
- Prioritize Server Components. Move client components down the tree. To minimize client-side JavaScript, move interactive elements (e.g., components with state, event handlers) into their own Client Components, while keeping the parent components (like layouts and page structures) as Server Components. This avoids sending unnecessary JavaScript to the client.
- whenever you create something new, if there is something left to do, then add a comment with TODO: with it.

Think from the perspective of the end user. Always make the user experience as smooth as possible. And the UI should be as elegant as possible.
All pages andlayouts should be responsive and mobile first.
We use Indian rupee for all prices and currency.
